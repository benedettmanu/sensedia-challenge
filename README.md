# Sensedia Challenge

## Prerequisites

- Node.js v22.15.0

## Install dependencies

```bash
nvm use 22 && npm install
```

## Running the Project

After installing the dependencies, you can start the development server by running:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The application should now be running on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) (or on a different port if configured differently). Any changes you make in the source files will trigger a live reload during development.
